  desc  "As a rule, accounts on a web server are to be kept to a minimum. Only
  administrators, web managers, developers, auditors, and web authors require
  accounts on the machine hosting the web server. This is in addition to the
  anonymous web user account. The resources to which these accounts have access
  must also be closely monitored and controlled. Only the SA needs access to all
  the systemâ€™s capabilities, while the web administrator and associated staff
  require access and control of the web content and web server configuration
  files. The anonymous web user account must not have access to system resources
  as that account could then control the server."
